# Brick Breaker in Pure JavaScript

Creation of a "Brick Breaker" mini game, as part of my DISII training.

Mini-game designed entirely in JavaScript, several levels are available.

## How to play

**You have to move the paddle, to bounce the ball on it and break all the bricks.**

To move the paddle:
- Use Mouse
- ← & → OR letter Q / A & D 

⚠ The ball increases its speed by 10% up to 80% with each bounce on the paddle.

Look above the game window for the number of tries.
